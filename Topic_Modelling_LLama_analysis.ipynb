       "      <td>Most of the game past the first two areas, and especially past the Capitol, is rehashed, copy-pasted content with almost nothing unique.\\nBeyond this, encounter design is practically nonexistent. Enemies are usually just plopped down in masses with very little thought, or it's some kind of trap. \\nBoss design is utterly horrendous. This isn't an issue of being too difficult. Rather, the bosses reach an extreme level of imbalance. Most bosses I fought died without really threatening me at all; some of them I killed through stunlocking, or doing so much damage that they weren't able to get a hit in, despite being level-appropriate and having challenging mobs leading up to them.\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, bosses seem designed to be frustrating and to punish veterans of the game. This isn't really a flaw by itself, as veterans need to be challenged lest they lose the satisfaction of overcoming adversity which is so central to these games. Rather, the problem is the complete lack of rhythm to these fights. To fuck up those experienced with their games, Fromsoft made every boss feint their attacks, or have randomly-timed counterattacks. The end result are boss fights which lack any smoothness or flow, relying pretty much entirely on reaction. The most fun part of combat - the aggression and the punish - is minimized in favor of almost endless kiting and dodging for perhaps one or two R1s. Adding onto this, the damage of many bosses is overtuned to the point where high-vigor, high-armor characters can get almost oneshot by most attacks. \\nEven with these bosses, however, I found little meaningful challenge. This isn't to play up my own ability. I'm sure that, had I opted out of magic and spirit ashes, these bosses would have made me want to kill myself, but instead most were dispatched with very little of my own input. Spirit ashes are incredibly overpowered in combination with magic, and the fact that these fights were apparently designed with ashes in mind is baffling. It's simply not rewarding.\\n\\nI think Elden Ring could have been a fantastic game given another three years of development and a more refined, less corrupted philosophy on encounter and boss design. The level design of some dungeons is very enjoyable. As it stands, the game feels emasculated as you reach the end of the game. One sees almost everything there is to offer by the time they finish Limgrave and Liurnia, and I'm guessing this is why so many games journalists sang the praises for this game, since most don't get an opportunity to finish the games they review. The level of rehashed assets goes above and beyond even DS1's lategame. And beyond that, the encounter and boss design feels incredibly uninspired, ill-balanced and untested.\\nIf you're a poor Brazillian or a fromsoft fan with the patience of a Buddha who hasn't jumped for this game yet, I would give it another several years for balance patches and DLC. And when you do play, I do not advise exploring the entire world past Liurnia. Maybe look up a guide or something and see what items you want, and just go for them. Otherwise you'll just get burnt out on the content like I did, because the level of recycled content is among the highest I've ever seen in an open world game.\\n\\nAlso, don't mind the hours, I tried the game out before buying and copied my save over.</td>\n",

However this game is designed to explore the open world as much as possible to collect many beneficial items so if you go through the main route then enemies and bosses are ridiculously tough like you literally need to spam hundreds of attack on each boss fight to defeat them and easy to get bored and exhausted enough.\\n\\nSo basically you have two choices, spending over 100 hours for exploring the empty open world to find many optional areas and fight copy and paste boring enemies to get strong weapons for main bosses, or just hundreds times spamming the attack bottom to defeat them.  \\n\\nElden Ring is the worst Souls like game.

The intro is just a bunch of unexplained events happening with nothing to draw you into the game, like i'm somehow supposed to give a shit about \"the shattering\".\\n\\nBut the bigger issue for me is that, even after 3 whole dark soul games coming out we have somehow gotten worse with the class balance.  I get magic is strong, but why the hell are melee builds unviable?  Every time I have to fight a boss I need to overlevel because everyone is super fast combo/aoe spam.  I'm fighting gotrik atm with no real opportunity to hit him b/c every attack is either a huge aoe or flurry of attacks.   Somehow we haven't learned from DS 3 where every damn boss is super fast and hard hitting wanting to push you into ranged bs. I could go magic, but fuck that, magic is boring.  \\n\\nAlso, where the fuck are all the weapons?  I'm exploring and grinding out for 6 hours now and haven't found dickall for gear. These games are usually good about this.\\n\\nEdit:  So i'm 100+ hours in and running through the final boss and all the other endgame content and my initial reaction was right.  Honestly fuck this lazy, shallow, cheap game. If the designers are going to make specific builds be the \"correct\" builds just design the game around that like sekiro and bloodborne.  Don't pretend to give us choice only to punish players (rip great weapon users).\\n\\nHonestly, the thing I never see people complain about is the lack of homeward bone as at least in previous DS titles you had the chance of getting your souls back from a soul trap boss rooms without having to figure out how to fetch your souls and kill the thing.

Endgame feels like a large leap from Late-Game in terms of difficulty, and you are often better not engaging in field bosses. Especially since the rewards feel random at times and most effective builds specialize around one gimmick. I recommend guides if you do get this game, otherwise you will have to burn a lot of Larval Tears. A limited resource to re-spec, not a great choice for a game with too many decisions. Don't play fair, the game sure doesn't. In fact, just don't get it. Monster Hunter Rise is superior albeit more grind heavy.

       "3810  Most of the game past the first two areas, and especially past the Capitol, is rehashed, copy-pasted content with almost nothing unique.\\nBeyond this, encounter design is practically nonexistent. Enemies are usually just plopped down in masses with very little thought, or it's some kind of trap. \\nBoss design is utterly horrendous. This isn't an issue of being too difficult. Rather, the bosses reach an extreme level of imbalance. Most bosses I fought died without really threatening me at all; some of them I killed through stunlocking, or doing so much damage that they weren't able to get a hit in, despite being level-appropriate and having challenging mobs leading up to them.\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, bosses seem designed to be frustrating and to punish veterans of the game. This isn't really a flaw by itself, as veterans need to be challenged lest they lose the satisfaction of overcoming adversity which is so central to these games. Rather, the problem is the complete lack of rhythm to these fights. To fuck up those experienced with their games, Fromsoft made every boss feint their attacks, or have randomly-timed counterattacks. The end result are boss fights which lack any smoothness or flow, relying pretty much entirely on reaction. The most fun part of combat - the aggression and the punish - is minimized in favor of almost endless kiting and dodging for perhaps one or two R1s. Adding onto this, the damage of many bosses is overtuned to the point where high-vigor, high-armor characters can get almost oneshot by most attacks. \\nEven with these bosses, however, I found little meaningful challenge. This isn't to play up my own ability. I'm sure that, had I opted out of magic and spirit ashes, these bosses would have made me want to kill myself, but instead most were dispatched with very little of my own input. Spirit ashes are incredibly overpowered in combination with magic, and the fact that these fights were apparently designed with ashes in mind is baffling. It's simply not rewarding.\\n\\nI think Elden Ring could have been a fantastic game given another three years of development and a more refined, less corrupted philosophy on encounter and boss design. The level design of some dungeons is very enjoyable. As it stands, the game feels emasculated as you reach the end of the game. One sees almost everything there is to offer by the time they finish Limgrave and Liurnia, and I'm guessing this is why so many games journalists sang the praises for this game, since most don't get an opportunity to finish the games they review. The level of rehashed assets goes above and beyond even DS1's lategame. And beyond that, the encounter and boss design feels incredibly uninspired, ill-balanced and untested.\\nIf you're a poor Brazillian or a fromsoft fan with the patience of a Buddha who hasn't jumped for this game yet, I would give it another several years for balance patches and DLC. And when you do play, I do not advise exploring the entire world past Liurnia. Maybe look up a guide or something and see what items you want, and just go for them. Otherwise you'll just get burnt out on the content like I did, because the level of recycled content is among the highest I've ever seen in an open world game.\\n\\nAlso, don't mind the hours, I tried the game out before buying and copied my save over.   \n",

Not like Dark Souls series, Elden Ring prioritizes the low grade quantity rather than the good quality.\\n\\nOf course you could ignore detour courses to focus on the main route so that you could fight only the \"original\" bosses. However this game is designed to explore the open world as much as possible to collect many beneficial items so if you go through the main route then enemies and bosses are ridiculously tough like you literally need to spam hundreds of attack on each boss fight to defeat them and easy to get bored and exhausted enough.\\n\\nSo basically you have two choices, spending over 100 hours for exploring the empty open world to find many optional areas and fight copy and paste boring enemies to get strong weapons for main bosses, or just hundreds times spamming the attack bottom to defeat them.  \\n\\nElden Ring is the worst Souls like game. Overhyped and overrated, just time consuming garbage.   \n",

The original game has terrible a gatekeeping crafting system that forces people to use CHEAT ENGINE and exploits to dupe items. Invasion system that allows and promotes people to exploit and use CHEAT ENGINE and other hacks to have MAXIMUM STATS AND ITEMS at level 1. Worse lag than 1990s dial up in multiplayer that encourages people to use LAG SWITCHES and throttle their bandwidth to kill you from across a room. Terrible unforgiveable progression system that forces you to NEVER PLAY WITH PEOPLE AGAIN in an area you've completed. Hitboxes worse than 1990s games. Pathing and floor mapping worse than 1990s games; be prepared to fall through the paper thin floor to your DEATH simply because their HORRIBLE server has lag. Collision detection worse than 1990s games where every enemy can hit you THROUGH A WALL, THROUGH THE FLOOR, OR EVEN NOT AT ALL AND STILL TAKE DAMAGE. Stay away from the base game and MOD IT.   \n",

The intro is just a bunch of unexplained events happening with nothing to draw you into the game, like i'm somehow supposed to give a shit about \"the shattering\".\\n\\nBut the bigger issue for me is that, even after 3 whole dark soul games coming out we have somehow gotten worse with the class balance.  I get magic is strong, but why the hell are melee builds unviable?  Every time I have to fight a boss I need to overlevel because everyone is super fast combo/aoe spam.  I'm fighting gotrik atm with no real opportunity to hit him b/c every attack is either a huge aoe or flurry of attacks.   Somehow we haven't learned from DS 3 where every damn boss is super fast and hard hitting wanting to push you into ranged bs. I could go magic, but fuck that, magic is boring.  \\n\\nAlso, where the fuck are all the weapons?  I'm exploring and grinding out for 6 hours now and haven't found dickall for gear. These games are usually good about this.\\n\\nEdit:  So i'm 100+ hours in and running through the final boss and all the other endgame content and my initial reaction was right.  Honestly fuck this lazy, shallow, cheap game. If the designers are going to make specific builds be the \"correct\" builds just design the game around that like sekiro and bloodborne.  Don't pretend to give us choice only to punish players (rip great weapon users).\\n\\nHonestly, the thing I never see people complain about is the lack of homeward bone as at least in previous DS titles you had the chance of getting your souls back from a soul trap boss rooms without having to figure out how to fetch your souls and kill the thing.  I am staggered by the sheer disrespect to my time this game has. Truly incredible.   \n",

The most fun boss was [spoiler]Radagon[/spoiler] and the least was [spoiler]Elden Beast[/spoiler]. [spoiler]A shame that you have to repeat the Radagon fight to even get an attempt at Elden Beast.[/spoiler] Often what hits you is just as surprising as what doesn't, and that's without using the inadequate servers. Endgame feels like a large leap from Late-Game in terms of difficulty, and you are often better not engaging in field bosses. Especially since the rewards feel random at times and most effective builds specialize around one gimmick. I recommend guides if you do get this game, otherwise you will have to burn a lot of Larval Tears. A limited resource to re-spec, not a great choice for a game with too many decisions. Don't play fair, the game sure doesn't. In fact, just don't get it. Monster Hunter Rise is superior albeit more grind heavy. Though if you don't use remembrances for levels, this game is too.   \n",

I'm refunding the game and will check back in a few months if they have straightened out this mess. \\n\\nWhat is there and I got to experience was enjoyable and interesting, plus its a beautiful game.   \n",

I WAS PROMISED ELDEN BUSSY, SO WHY I GOTTA KILL ALL THESE CRUSTY OLD MEN, GOD FUCKING DAMN WASTED MY TIME!\\n\\n\\n\\n(Old Review)\\n\\nPretty juicer experience, 9/10 would have my skull collide with a granite cube again. Though there are some problems, BIG PROBLEMS! Which is why no blue review, so sad!\\n\\n- Biggest problem… THE F-ING CAMERA! BRO I WAS FIGHTING THIS THING HARDER THAN THE BOSS IN SOME FIGHTS, THOSE DAMN DRAGONS, DAMN RADAN METEOR STRIKE, WTF!!! LET ME LOOK GODDAMN UP AS I SPAM MY HORSE! (I also feel incredibly bad for people who suffer from motion-sickness because this thing was brutal and turning off motion-blur actually may have made it worse for certain bosses.) \\n- Also screw the auto-lock feature, actually one of the worst auto-locks I’ve had to suffer through for 100+ hours, made me want to obliterate another one of my granite cubes!\\n- Laggy areas, now I ain't talking that damn forest in BOTW, but more like the game suffers from immense pop-in or something in highly detailed areas or something, no idea, frame-rate would slam through a granite cube sometime.\\n- Lag in general making me want to slam my head through a granite cube!\\n- Achievements are not obtainable offline, like whaaaa. Kinda cringe bro, although who cares about these things anyways. (Just sad it will forever look like I only got halfway through the game in 111 hours to my friends.)\\n- ALSO, please bring me to new items or at least highlight them in inventory, saving an actual hour of searching through that thing wondering if the obscure piece of parchment you just received was a quest item, a letter, a charm, or whatever the heck! SLAM MY HEAD IN GRANITE CUBE MOMENT!\\n- Had quite a few random crashes, not during bosses though, thank god (Wait, some were). Seemed to be more with random geometry and me horse or something.\\n- How have devs not realized that calculating fall damage based on the amount of time falling is the worst way to do it! Got stuck in between two buildings? Fall to death! Tried to jump off a small pillar but accidentally used horse double-jump before landing, leaving you in the air another second? DEATH! Glitched anywhere with a horizontal bounding box? DEATH DEATH! I do not like a game giving me Astroneer flashbacks, PLEASE!\\n- Used controller a bit, and I actually prefer keyboard and mouse, I don’t know, call me a heretic, but like, I like to be able to edit things onto my thousand button Logitech mouse. Too bad there were a few things in the game which made mouse and keyboard an absolute pain! AND FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THEY ARE STILL USING THE SAME UI AS DARK SOULS ONE! GOD DAMN 2010 X-BOX PROMPTS! (To mention a few, camera spinning out of control when mouse is even slightly lifted, original bindings suck, Prompts not auto-changing, Q to go back… really, needing to navigate menus like your using a controller with keyboard, Certain vital actions being unbindable, FLIPPIN INPUT DELAY, (although this actually seems like a universal problem with the lag.)\\n\\n(As for my only problem with the actual game)\\n- Don't really know how much I agree with the encounter theory in this game. It seems like FromSoft was thinkin HEY, they probably explored the shit out of the area and are level bajillion anyways, they probably have a kit specifically tailored to this boss, or a thousand items to burn through. Meaning they do not care how much shit they throw at you in this game. Boss that randomly flurry-attacks 30 times in a matter of seconds and is practically undodgeable without teleport roll, got that, boss who summons dozens of little boys and shit, got that, Literal mile wide poison swamps, YES, Throwing half a dozen bosses at you at once because why the heck now!!!, OF COURSE! like, the amount of times I was insta-killed in this game for bull reasons just because of the amount of moves and things to pay attention to for each boss was insane. In other dark-souls or souls-likes I understood my deaths. Maybe it was a trap or the boss stepped on me, maybe I dodged into his giant sword. But this game's all, NAWWW BITCH, I'm gonna randomly come in meteor form from a random direction and insta-kill you and the camera will fight you to even try to see me so just spam your horse and pray!\\nLemme actually rephrase my dislike for the bosses. In this game bosses are incredibly hard, but every one has some sort of item, or cheesy doo-dad which completely trivializes them. Most of this difficulty also originates from the amount of unexpectedness and depth of their movesets. Some good examples are Radahn and Miquella. Like, even DS vets were using summons and cheesy boss-counter things for these. I don’t know if many people at all actually killed them the OG way with a sword and some skillful rolling, it just doesn't seem possible unless you do 100+ tries and have a girthy stamina bar for those 10+ hit combos or whatever. Bosses were either incredibly difficult, maybe too much or more-so than every other souls game, or incredibly easy if you decided to actually use the cheese items (Mimic tear, I’m looking at you). It just felt like fair fights were few and far between. I actually probably got more of those from the random dungeons and crucible knights/Evergoals placed around the map. For the actual bosses, most of my deaths were to incredibly gimmicky insta-kill abilities, and all you needed to do was find an item which negated that gimmicky ability to instantly destroy them first try. The item typically being mimic tear. Maybe after the 40th boss pulls out his insta kill-god javelin you get pretty tired of these. I was just ready to beat the game in the latter 30 hours. Although this could have been the intent. TBF, it was pretty epic in some areas and a lot of this was a breath of fresh air from the more standard and predictable dark souls bosses.\\n\\nAlthough yea, other than that. One of the largest games I’ve ever played. Was amazing. BUT THEY NEED TO FIX THIS SHIT BEFORE I’LL GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW! Who knows, maybe I’m just tired after fighting as many bosses as Monster Hunter World in a week, except every single one is Rajang. Maybe the game was a bit too long, I’ll probably make this review positive once I come back and play new-game+. But I am tired, and I am ready to play something else for a month! I AM OUT OF GRANITE CUBES!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Its with a heavy heart I cannot reccommend this with confidence. Massive souls fan which would explain the patience to even play this game as long as I did. Half of the time so far invading people with about 800 successful invasions. I hope this type of game is NOT what From decides to do going forward and since Steam doesnt allow me a \"Meh\" im stuck with thumbs down. This game is so poorly made I dont think id buy another Open World souls.\\n\\n[h1] Pitiful Performance [/h1]\\nThis game runs like complete ass. I have above minimum specs and will still stutter in most areas. Turns out this its an issue with even the highest of quality PCs. Constant and frequent disconnects from all forms of multiplayer. Whether its beind forcibly disconnected half way through a boss, 4 minutes into helping a friend through a level, or mid fight with a host and his 2 phantoms. Half of all your multiplayer sessions will be forcibly disconnected with zero recourse. Some blame EAC but who knows.\\n\\n[h1] Open World Woes and Reused content [/h1]\\nThis is the part of the game I blame for most of its frustrating and boring shortcomings. Anything and everything to deal with your horse makes the game worse. Horse combat is boring with 2 attacks and being constantly thrown off by weirdly inconsistent damage. Your horse doesnt scale at all either making late game horse combat completely pointless (or subsequent playthroughs) when the air of a weapon swing will instantly kill your mount.\\n\\nThe reused and copy pasted content in this game is absolutely pathetic. The overworld having the same 3 knights plastered on every inch of the massive map with slight reskins. The dozens of Catacombs all looking the same, with slightly different layouts, and exclusively filled with 1 enemy or if lucky the occasional skeleton. Insultingly so with specific bosses. Fighting Tree Avatar 12 times, Ulcerated Tree Spirit 6, Stone Gargoyle Guardian's ~10, Tibia Mariner 4-5, same Dragon 6+, magma wyrm 3. Numerous occassions where the boss is just an enemy you already fought in the same \"dungeon\" just with a slighter higher HP. Double bosses are everywhere. They simply take two normal enemies you've fought dozens of times before, slap them together in the same room, and call it a boss. They even have the audacity to reuse bosses that could be really cool if not copy pasted somewhere else. Like Astel, Mohg, Godfrey, Loretta.\\n\\nThis Open World does have 1 advantage. You can on subsequent playthroughs safely ignore 80% of the content and not miss anything at all. Literally never enter a catacomb for any reason and you're good to go.\\n\\n[h1] Bosses are the worst they've ever been [/h1]\\nThis coincides with the reused content. Not much should need to be repeated about how terrible fighting the same bosses constantly is. Bosses especially in the later half of the game are terrible and I dont see how people defend them. They clearly decided to go style over substance with alot of them.\\n\\nRadahn's obnoxious approach, massive swings and combos, hyper mobility, weird gimmick of summoning useless NPCs, and his beyond stupid appearance and mechanics. Malenia's Waterfowl dance, dash multi hit, and Phase two phantom attack. Elden Beast being a giant middle finger to melee builds. Astel being the same with him being 10 feet off the ground, AoE attack you cant dodge or jump over when in melee range, and ability to teleport the other side of its arena. Fire Giant period. Godskin duo being two bosses you've fought twice already before, having more then the duo's HP bar and actually being a 4 boss fight, and fatroll. Even everyone's first casual filter Margit has janky bullshit. Knife double slash, staff into hammer swing. Two attacks that WILL catch you mid roll because of how they're staggered.\\n\\n[h1] PvP and invasions [/h1]\\n Again frequent disconnects. Half of invasions will be dropped. Some people like to tout the game is balanced because everything is broken. This isnt true at all. Maybe every stat has something OP but most weapons/playstyles are not even close to being useful.\\n\\nForced gank squads by players only being invadable by either Summoning a co-op partner first or using a specific item to allow multiple people to invade. Soul's shit netcode somehow being even worse with invisible phantoms and laggy or completely invisible spells hitting you in one massive clump. Password system allowing for most invasions to have a phantom in it more then double your level or sometimes people at the level cap. Ive earned 950,000 runes from killing a phantom before. Its common to earn 50-100k runes while invading people at level 25 from bad players summoning their friends.\\n\\nFaith has Madness which abuses shitty netcode for guranteed stuns/damage. Dragon skills that have massive undodgeable AoEs. Made worse by Rot breath inflicting a NASTY status. Intelligence has Moonveil and Stars of Ruin. Dex is like normal better then everything else but not because of the normal damage Dex does. Status effects are insanely strong in this game. Bleed is beyond abuseable and if it doesnt proc in 1 hit from certain builds its going to proc in 2 or 3 for a stun and half your HP bar. Freeze/bleed builds are everywhere and cannot be matched by anything else in the game for PvP or PvE. Because of said Frost they still end up doing higher damage with Magic/Phys split with zero stat investment. Statues are so broken that even STR users two handing 60 STR weapons are lowering their Phys damage for that sweet Frost.\\n\\nReally any blood art bleeds and does way to much damage. While I understand not every Ash will be perfectly balanced alot of them are. Most are good and useable but theres a very select few that dominate the game, are not balanced, and sit comfortably way above everything else.\\n\\nJumping and crouching add numerous additional moves and make combat more interesting and varied. The heaviest weapons while still terrible in this game wouldnt even be useable at all without jumping attacks. Collosal sword's crouch poke, dual whips jump attack, alot of dual weapons sprint attacks.\\n\\nEdit: Taking out the part about bug abuse, Hoarfrost, and bleed slash. Not even hours after I intially posted this review From dropped a patch which removed the bugs and nerfed the Ashes. Status is still the same.\\n\\n[h1] The PvE and Souls experience [/h1]\\nI havent mentioned PvE anywhere else because from a balance perspective I dont actually care if players use things like Mimic Tear. Its a summon restricted exclusively to single player. I dont care how players play by themselves.\\n\\nThe normal level design is still in this game and its just as quality as ever. If not better because of added verticality with jumping. Stromveil, Haligtree, Academy, Ruins Precipice, Caria Manor, Volcano, and others. All normal Soul's level natually placed into the world. They make heading through the 19th catacomb with 1 enemy type, a reused bose, and for a single spirit summon at the end seem even worse by comparison.\\n\\n[h1] The Verdict [/h1]\\nGame isnt bad but its the worst Souls game From has made inargueably. More content does not mean GOOD content. Its about 40-50 hours of content streched and reused into 80-100. Some additions are great but muddied like Ashes of war. Things like Jumping and its added gameplay is amazing. PvP is playable technicly but only the most sadistic SoBs who enjoy stomping the odd new player more then they get frustrated from disconnecting from half their invasions or being 3v1 magic spammed. \\n\\nGame is about a 6/10 currently and after some patches to maybe improve its performance and hopefully balance out some of the game breaking stuff. It may go up to a 7/10. People stating its a masterpiece havent played more then a couple hours of it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Let me preface this that Elden Ring is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. An expansive dreadful yet whimsical world with art direction some of the best ever. It's combat system the best it has ever been with tons of depth and complexity. You should play this game, it's amazing, but I must not recommend it here to get you past the blinds of blind positivity surrounding this game, because it is no where perfect. This review is simply about the worst thing about this game, everything else is pretty stellar\\n\\nFromsoft has made an amazing open world experience that fuels exploration, creativity, and interest in the world's story. The problem arises with everything else, especially the meat, which in a souls game, is the bosses. The way bosses are lined up and how that line can be broken thanks to the open world setting makes it so you can wander upon an enemy, figure out its moveset there, then go back to an earlier area and face it as an actual boss. Here there is no challenge, it's simply extending a fight because of how the game handles a mob as a boss, simply increasing it's health (by a lot). There is also the opposite, where you will have beaten a boss before, there will be another boss fight with just 2 of them. During my playthrough this was only a growing pain and made me wish for more interesting boss fights. There are unique boss fights, and a lot of them are really cool, but there really was nothing special as compared to the past games. Still spectacles in their own right, just not what I wanted from some of the bigger main fights in the game. Of course scaling is always an issue when it comes to open world games, but the lack of interesting boss variety really drags it down. \\n\\nThe game's bosses also have this issue where the same strategy can be applied to all, which limits the amount of viable builds one can use to have an enjoyable time working through its bosses. For my first playthrough of souls games I like doing only strength, but it became near impossible thanks to recovery frames of my swings that I felt forced to trade during almost every encounter. The new systems of npc summons are almost forced to be used because of the boss designs in this game.\\n\\nThere is another problem involving the difficulties of phases with individual bosses, some will have massive health pools or time consuming first phases with extremely punishing 2nd phases, which only leads to frustration and droning with each attempt taking longer than necessary with little to no engagement.\\n\\nLastly, I came into this game expecting the horse combat to play a more active role in terms of boss fights, but outside of exploration (where it is still extremely fun to use), it feels as if no bosses where you can use a horse was the boss designed with you using the horse in mind. Some actively punish you for using the horse, but at that point why?\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>After all the hype, I was pretty disappointed. This game is not bad, but it has a lot of issues and greatly overstays its welcome.\\n\\nFirst of all, the big open world doesn't really add anything to the experience. It just means you have to monotonously ride around on your horse from one level to another. The game takes away your horse the moment you enter a dungeon, so that you have a true Souls experience, which shows that even the developers weren't committed to an idea of a big world where you can do whatever you want. These are just your typical Dark Souls levels with a lot of empty space in between.\\nIt's also clear they bit off more than they could chew here. The world is huge, but the content is really stretched thin over it. You fight almost every boss at least three times. A lot of bosses are regular enemies with bigger health bars. A lot of dungeons are just the same dungeon with slightly different room arrangement. Even beyond all that you keep fighting a lot of the same enemies throughout the world: same several types of knights, same giants, same golems etc. I don't mind some asset reuse in videogames, but here it gets pretty bad. Soulsborne games were always great at making each area feel unique with its own set of unique enemies, and almost none of that is here. A lot of areas feel roughly the same. \\n\\nWhat's probably worst of all is that despite this being a 6th or 7th title (depending on whether you include Sekiro or not) in the semi-unofficial Soulsborne series, lots of series problems big and small remain unaddressed even in this title. \\nThe camera and lock on system are still bad, and become a huge problem in cramped areas or when fighting giant enemies (and there's a lot of giant enemies here).\\nEnemies can still hit you through walls, even though your own attacks bounce off them, which is super unfair.\\nCritical hits and backstabs are still incredibly finicky to do, meaning you just fail to do them and just perform a regular attack when you stand in a slightly wrong way. Extra bad, when you consider the issue was already solved in Bloodborne. \\n\\nThere's many more, but you get the point. It's really strange to see a developer make the same type of game for over a decade now and still not able to fix these issues (or fixing them in some games only to unfix them in the next title).\\n\\nNow, is the game bad? No. It has plenty of good in it. It looks gorgeous, the art direction and atmosphere are amazing. The build variety for the player is huge, with ability to customize the experience in many ways. The key levels, the ones that clearly had the most time and effort put into them, are almost all amazing to explore, and you can legitimately get lost in these levels with how big they are. The characters are interesting, and the story can be quite intriguing at times. And combat is pretty fun, if still pretty simplistic compared to games in similar genre.\\n\\nBut I don't know why you'd want to play this over any Dark Souls titles. They have all of the things above, but they also are much tighter and polished experiences with variety that is not present in Elden Ring. Those games have so many unique, interesting ideas, whereas Elden Ring feels like a much more toned-down, less unique sort of game made for broad appeal. It's lacking a lot of the soul, pardon the pun. And despite being made for a wider market, I can't say it brings the fixes and the polish that a mass product like this requires. It's a Souls game with a lot of the \"good\" cut out, but also with almost none of the \"bad\" fixed. So I'd only recommend it to someone who's just sick of replaying the previous titles and wants more of the same from the original developers. \\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

All From Software games share a considerable amount of serious issues among all of them that FS has never been competent enough to fix (camera issues, terrible netcode, lots of glitches, etc).

       "      <td>I finished the game. I did all the optional hard bosses like Dragonlord Placidusax, Melina, ect., I'm sorry to give it a thumbs down but for me after all was said and done I wouldn't have regretted not playing the game at all, I won't play any potential DLC, and I deleted it from my SSD within 5 minutes of finishing it; in other words I was glad to get it over with. The main reason for the negativity was game immersion, which was always short lived when I was playing, I felt I constantly needed to go on the internet to find something, figure how to do something, figure a quest out and so on, it was a royal and constant pain in the but. The devs put so much into creating a huge and content filled world but left too many things to \"figure out\" on your own with little to no hints as to what to do. On top of that they had some truly annoying AI coding that allowed mobs to hit you with melee attacks through walls, keep targeting you and hit you with spells through walls with no line of site. It was a complete annoyance, meanwhile your avatar's melee weapon bounced off walls as it should, and you lost lock on when you lost line of site. While I've played all the Dark Souls games and Sekiro I'll check the reviews and game play carefully before I consider buying a sequel to Elden Ring. Some may wonder why I bothered to finish it and I would say it was a combination of being a little obsessive and not wanting to let myself back down from the challenge because it was difficult like Dark Souls games and I had more than my fair share of deaths that made me determined to get back up and kill that dam boss or mini boss. Ultimately I was sorry I started it, and couldn't wait to get to over with, hence the negative review.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It's like if Tommy Wiseau was co-producer of Lord of the Rings.  \\n\\nWhat I mean by that, is there is a lot of awesome stuff in this game, but it is interwoven with sloppy garbage.  I could make a list of a 100 things that don't actually deliver that would have been easy to fix.  \\n\\nThere are almost no sections of the game that are purely good or purely bad.  The bad and good aspects are so thoroughly mixed that no part of the game is particularly satisfying.  Overall a big, epic, sloppy, surprisingly unpolished, and lackluster experience.  \\n\\nIf you've got a lot of time on your hands (if you want to get close to 100%-ing the game you're talking around 100 hours) then possibly a worthy buy on discount but other than that avoid this game.</td>\n",

i love the souls series and bloodbourne specifically, i tried loving elden ring but i do not like the souls formula transformed into an open world game, you probably will.   \n",

                                  This game is simply full of bullshit. Every enemy will stagger you but when you attack the enemy they don't get staggered. Not to mention when 3 enemies come after you and you try to attack but are repeatedly interrupted by their 1 second off attacks. Lets not forget about long range balista units or those stupid spirit things in the underground river that see you from halfway across the map even if you are crouching and staying hidden. Was so bad that I entered an area crouching and next thing I know the spirits are trying to shoot me through the rock, you could literally see piles of arrows stuck in the rock without them even having seen me yet. balistas are the same dam way dam thing is spamming a wall that i'm standing behind and it doesn't help that if it hits you then you get knocked over. And lets not forget to mention the bs that is the grace sights. Sat there and killed 30 enemies then went to the grace sight because what do you know of all 30 enemies none of them replenished my vials. MISTAKE, if you visit a grace sight all enemies you already killed sit there and respawn, so basically makes all the work pointless.   \n",

you.\\nElden ring is a extreme difficulty dodge roll simulator , very annoying finger gymnastics, nothing else.\\nNon combat content is very limited, play through doesn't offer alternate ways of clearing content nor progressing thru the story, after 50th death one forgets about it anyway. \\nStandard ways of dealing with  hard action combat such as more health potions or over leveling content doesnt work due to the fact number of potions is set and character level doesn't change much during combat. \"Vast\" world, which may appeal to some is a letdown too, as all you find is more combat , thats it.\\n95% of the playtime is a combat following one pattern : dodge roll X times to attack X times to dodge roll X times...  \\nGame is made in a way to make it impossible to refund due to the fact that tutorial and first steps in the game are easy enough and make one believe the game offers variety of activities appealing for variety of players, not just combat enthusiasts.\\nStorytelling is interesting, but there is very little of it and, as i mentioned before, made insignificant due to combat difficulty, Graphics? sorry, no time to appreciate it, to busy dodge rolling . \\n   \n",

I WAS PROMISED ELDEN BUSSY, SO WHY I GOTTA KILL ALL THESE CRUSTY OLD MEN, GOD FUCKING DAMN WASTED MY TIME!\\n\\n\\n\\n(Old Review)\\n\\nPretty juicer experience, 9/10 would have my skull collide with a granite cube again. Though there are some problems, BIG PROBLEMS! Which is why no blue review, so sad!\\n\\n- Biggest problem… THE F-ING CAMERA! BRO I WAS FIGHTING THIS THING HARDER THAN THE BOSS IN SOME FIGHTS, THOSE DAMN DRAGONS, DAMN RADAN METEOR STRIKE, WTF!!! LET ME LOOK GODDAMN UP AS I SPAM MY HORSE! (I also feel incredibly bad for people who suffer from motion-sickness because this thing was brutal and turning off motion-blur actually may have made it worse for certain bosses.) \\n- Also screw the auto-lock feature, actually one of the worst auto-locks I’ve had to suffer through for 100+ hours, made me want to obliterate another one of my granite cubes!\\n- Laggy areas, now I ain't talking that damn forest in BOTW, but more like the game suffers from immense pop-in or something in highly detailed areas or something, no idea, frame-rate would slam through a granite cube sometime.\\n- Lag in general making me want to slam my head through a granite cube!\\n- Achievements are not obtainable offline, like whaaaa. Kinda cringe bro, although who cares about these things anyways. (Just sad it will forever look like I only got halfway through the game in 111 hours to my friends.)\\n- ALSO, please bring me to new items or at least highlight them in inventory, saving an actual hour of searching through that thing wondering if the obscure piece of parchment you just received was a quest item, a letter, a charm, or whatever the heck! SLAM MY HEAD IN GRANITE CUBE MOMENT!\\n- Had quite a few random crashes, not during bosses though, thank god (Wait, some were). Seemed to be more with random geometry and me horse or something.\\n- How have devs not realized that calculating fall damage based on the amount of time falling is the worst way to do it! Got stuck in between two buildings? Fall to death! Tried to jump off a small pillar but accidentally used horse double-jump before landing, leaving you in the air another second? DEATH! Glitched anywhere with a horizontal bounding box? DEATH DEATH! I do not like a game giving me Astroneer flashbacks, PLEASE!\\n- Used controller a bit, and I actually prefer keyboard and mouse, I don’t know, call me a heretic, but like, I like to be able to edit things onto my thousand button Logitech mouse. Too bad there were a few things in the game which made mouse and keyboard an absolute pain! AND FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THEY ARE STILL USING THE SAME UI AS DARK SOULS ONE! GOD DAMN 2010 X-BOX PROMPTS! (To mention a few, camera spinning out of control when mouse is even slightly lifted, original bindings suck, Prompts not auto-changing, Q to go back… really, needing to navigate menus like your using a controller with keyboard, Certain vital actions being unbindable, FLIPPIN INPUT DELAY, (although this actually seems like a universal problem with the lag.)\\n\\n(As for my only problem with the actual game)\\n- Don't really know how much I agree with the encounter theory in this game. It seems like FromSoft was thinkin HEY, they probably explored the shit out of the area and are level bajillion anyways, they probably have a kit specifically tailored to this boss, or a thousand items to burn through. Meaning they do not care how much shit they throw at you in this game. Boss that randomly flurry-attacks 30 times in a matter of seconds and is practically undodgeable without teleport roll, got that, boss who summons dozens of little boys and shit, got that, Literal mile wide poison swamps, YES, Throwing half a dozen bosses at you at once because why the heck now!!!, OF COURSE! like, the amount of times I was insta-killed in this game for bull reasons just because of the amount of moves and things to pay attention to for each boss was insane. In other dark-souls or souls-likes I understood my deaths. Maybe it was a trap or the boss stepped on me, maybe I dodged into his giant sword. But this game's all, NAWWW BITCH, I'm gonna randomly come in meteor form from a random direction and insta-kill you and the camera will fight you to even try to see me so just spam your horse and pray!\\nLemme actually rephrase my dislike for the bosses. In this game bosses are incredibly hard, but every one has some sort of item, or cheesy doo-dad which completely trivializes them. Most of this difficulty also originates from the amount of unexpectedness and depth of their movesets. Some good examples are Radahn and Miquella. Like, even DS vets were using summons and cheesy boss-counter things for these. I don’t know if many people at all actually killed them the OG way with a sword and some skillful rolling, it just doesn't seem possible unless you do 100+ tries and have a girthy stamina bar for those 10+ hit combos or whatever. Bosses were either incredibly difficult, maybe too much or more-so than every other souls game, or incredibly easy if you decided to actually use the cheese items (Mimic tear, I’m looking at you). It just felt like fair fights were few and far between. I actually probably got more of those from the random dungeons and crucible knights/Evergoals placed around the map. For the actual bosses, most of my deaths were to incredibly gimmicky insta-kill abilities, and all you needed to do was find an item which negated that gimmicky ability to instantly destroy them first try. The item typically being mimic tear. Maybe after the 40th boss pulls out his insta kill-god javelin you get pretty tired of these. I was just ready to beat the game in the latter 30 hours. Although this could have been the intent. TBF, it was pretty epic in some areas and a lot of this was a breath of fresh air from the more standard and predictable dark souls bosses.\\n\\nAlthough yea, other than that. One of the largest games I’ve ever played. Was amazing. BUT THEY NEED TO FIX THIS SHIT BEFORE I’LL GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW! Who knows, maybe I’m just tired after fighting as many bosses as Monster Hunter World in a week, except every single one is Rajang. Maybe the game was a bit too long, I’ll probably make this review positive once I come back and play new-game+. But I am tired, and I am ready to play something else for a month! I AM OUT OF GRANITE CUBES!   \n",
       "1296  Its with a heavy heart I cannot reccommend this with confidence. Massive souls fan which would explain the patience to even play this game as long as I did. Half of the time so far invading people with about 800 successful invasions. I hope this type of game is NOT what From decides to do going forward and since Steam doesnt allow me a \"Meh\" im stuck with thumbs down. This game is so poorly made I dont think id buy another Open World souls.\\n\\n[h1] Pitiful Performance [/h1]\\nThis game runs like complete ass. I have above minimum specs and will still stutter in most areas. Turns out this its an issue with even the highest of quality PCs. Constant and frequent disconnects from all forms of multiplayer. Whether its beind forcibly disconnected half way through a boss, 4 minutes into helping a friend through a level, or mid fight with a host and his 2 phantoms. Half of all your multiplayer sessions will be forcibly disconnected with zero recourse. Some blame EAC but who knows.\\n\\n[h1] Open World Woes and Reused content [/h1]\\nThis is the part of the game I blame for most of its frustrating and boring shortcomings. Anything and everything to deal with your horse makes the game worse. Horse combat is boring with 2 attacks and being constantly thrown off by weirdly inconsistent damage. Your horse doesnt scale at all either making late game horse combat completely pointless (or subsequent playthroughs) when the air of a weapon swing will instantly kill your mount.\\n\\nThe reused and copy pasted content in this game is absolutely pathetic. The overworld having the same 3 knights plastered on every inch of the massive map with slight reskins. The dozens of Catacombs all looking the same, with slightly different layouts, and exclusively filled with 1 enemy or if lucky the occasional skeleton. Insultingly so with specific bosses. Fighting Tree Avatar 12 times, Ulcerated Tree Spirit 6, Stone Gargoyle Guardian's ~10, Tibia Mariner 4-5, same Dragon 6+, magma wyrm 3. Numerous occassions where the boss is just an enemy you already fought in the same \"dungeon\" just with a slighter higher HP. Double bosses are everywhere. They simply take two normal enemies you've fought dozens of times before, slap them together in the same room, and call it a boss. They even have the audacity to reuse bosses that could be really cool if not copy pasted somewhere else. Like Astel, Mohg, Godfrey, Loretta.\\n\\nThis Open World does have 1 advantage. You can on subsequent playthroughs safely ignore 80% of the content and not miss anything at all. Literally never enter a catacomb for any reason and you're good to go.\\n\\n[h1] Bosses are the worst they've ever been [/h1]\\nThis coincides with the reused content. Not much should need to be repeated about how terrible fighting the same bosses constantly is. Bosses especially in the later half of the game are terrible and I dont see how people defend them. They clearly decided to go style over substance with alot of them.\\n\\nRadahn's obnoxious approach, massive swings and combos, hyper mobility, weird gimmick of summoning useless NPCs, and his beyond stupid appearance and mechanics. Malenia's Waterfowl dance, dash multi hit, and Phase two phantom attack. Elden Beast being a giant middle finger to melee builds. Astel being the same with him being 10 feet off the ground, AoE attack you cant dodge or jump over when in melee range, and ability to teleport the other side of its arena. Fire Giant period. Godskin duo being two bosses you've fought twice already before, having more then the duo's HP bar and actually being a 4 boss fight, and fatroll. Even everyone's first casual filter Margit has janky bullshit. Knife double slash, staff into hammer swing. Two attacks that WILL catch you mid roll because of how they're staggered.\\n\\n[h1] PvP and invasions [/h1]\\n Again frequent disconnects. Half of invasions will be dropped. Some people like to tout the game is balanced because everything is broken. This isnt true at all. Maybe every stat has something OP but most weapons/playstyles are not even close to being useful.\\n\\nForced gank squads by players only being invadable by either Summoning a co-op partner first or using a specific item to allow multiple people to invade. Soul's shit netcode somehow being even worse with invisible phantoms and laggy or completely invisible spells hitting you in one massive clump. Password system allowing for most invasions to have a phantom in it more then double your level or sometimes people at the level cap. Ive earned 950,000 runes from killing a phantom before. Its common to earn 50-100k runes while invading people at level 25 from bad players summoning their friends.\\n\\nFaith has Madness which abuses shitty netcode for guranteed stuns/damage. Dragon skills that have massive undodgeable AoEs. Made worse by Rot breath inflicting a NASTY status. Intelligence has Moonveil and Stars of Ruin. Dex is like normal better then everything else but not because of the normal damage Dex does. Status effects are insanely strong in this game. Bleed is beyond abuseable and if it doesnt proc in 1 hit from certain builds its going to proc in 2 or 3 for a stun and half your HP bar. Freeze/bleed builds are everywhere and cannot be matched by anything else in the game for PvP or PvE. Because of said Frost they still end up doing higher damage with Magic/Phys split with zero stat investment. Statues are so broken that even STR users two handing 60 STR weapons are lowering their Phys damage for that sweet Frost.\\n\\nReally any blood art bleeds and does way to much damage. While I understand not every Ash will be perfectly balanced alot of them are. Most are good and useable but theres a very select few that dominate the game, are not balanced, and sit comfortably way above everything else.\\n\\nJumping and crouching add numerous additional moves and make combat more interesting and varied. The heaviest weapons while still terrible in this game wouldnt even be useable at all without jumping attacks. Collosal sword's crouch poke, dual whips jump attack, alot of dual weapons sprint attacks.\\n\\nEdit: Taking out the part about bug abuse, Hoarfrost, and bleed slash. Not even hours after I intially posted this review From dropped a patch which removed the bugs and nerfed the Ashes. Status is still the same.\\n\\n[h1] The PvE and Souls experience [/h1]\\nI havent mentioned PvE anywhere else because from a balance perspective I dont actually care if players use things like Mimic Tear. Its a summon restricted exclusively to single player. I dont care how players play by themselves.\\n\\nThe normal level design is still in this game and its just as quality as ever. If not better because of added verticality with jumping. Stromveil, Haligtree, Academy, Ruins Precipice, Caria Manor, Volcano, and others. All normal Soul's level natually placed into the world. They make heading through the 19th catacomb with 1 enemy type, a reused bose, and for a single spirit summon at the end seem even worse by comparison.\\n\\n[h1] The Verdict [/h1]\\nGame isnt bad but its the worst Souls game From has made inargueably. More content does not mean GOOD content. Its about 40-50 hours of content streched and reused into 80-100. Some additions are great but muddied like Ashes of war. Things like Jumping and its added gameplay is amazing. PvP is playable technicly but only the most sadistic SoBs who enjoy stomping the odd new player more then they get frustrated from disconnecting from half their invasions or being 3v1 magic spammed. \\n\\nGame is about a 6/10 currently and after some patches to maybe improve its performance and hopefully balance out some of the game breaking stuff. It may go up to a 7/10. People stating its a masterpiece havent played more then a couple hours of it.   \n",

An expansive dreadful yet whimsical world with art direction some of the best ever. It's combat system the best it has ever been with tons of depth and complexity. You should play this game, it's amazing, but I must not recommend it here to get you past the blinds of blind positivity surrounding this game, because it is no where perfect. This review is simply about the worst thing about this game, everything else is pretty stellar\\n\\nFromsoft has made an amazing open world experience that fuels exploration, creativity, and interest in the world's story. The problem arises with everything else, especially the meat, which in a souls game, is the bosses. The way bosses are lined up and how that line can be broken thanks to the open world setting makes it so you can wander upon an enemy, figure out its moveset there, then go back to an earlier area and face it as an actual boss. Here there is no challenge, it's simply extending a fight because of how the game handles a mob as a boss, simply increasing it's health (by a lot). There is also the opposite, where you will have beaten a boss before, there will be another boss fight with just 2 of them. During my playthrough this was only a growing pain and made me wish for more interesting boss fights. There are unique boss fights, and a lot of them are really cool, but there really was nothing special as compared to the past games. Still spectacles in their own right, just not what I wanted from some of the bigger main fights in the game. Of course scaling is always an issue when it comes to open world games, but the lack of interesting boss variety really drags it down. \\n\\nThe game's bosses also have this issue where the same strategy can be applied to all, which limits the amount of viable builds one can use to have an enjoyable time working through its bosses. For my first playthrough of souls games I like doing only strength, but it became near impossible thanks to recovery frames of my swings that I felt forced to trade during almost every encounter. The new systems of npc summons are almost forced to be used because of the boss designs in this game.\\n\\nThere is another problem involving the difficulties of phases with individual bosses, some will have massive health pools or time consuming first phases with extremely punishing 2nd phases, which only leads to frustration and droning with each attempt taking longer than necessary with little to no engagement.\\n\\nLastly, I came into this game expecting the horse combat to play a more active role in terms of boss fights, but outside of exploration (where it is still extremely fun to use), it feels as if no bosses where you can use a horse was the boss designed with you using the horse in mind. Some actively punish you for using the horse, but at that point why?\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

This game is not bad, but it has a lot of issues and greatly overstays its welcome.\\n\\nFirst of all, the big open world doesn't really add anything to the experience. It just means you have to monotonously ride around on your horse from one level to another. The game takes away your horse the moment you enter a dungeon, so that you have a true Souls experience, which shows that even the developers weren't committed to an idea of a big world where you can do whatever you want. These are just your typical Dark Souls levels with a lot of empty space in between.\\nIt's also clear they bit off more than they could chew here. The world is huge, but the content is really stretched thin over it. You fight almost every boss at least three times. A lot of bosses are regular enemies with bigger health bars. A lot of dungeons are just the same dungeon with slightly different room arrangement. Even beyond all that you keep fighting a lot of the same enemies throughout the world: same several types of knights, same giants, same golems etc. I don't mind some asset reuse in videogames, but here it gets pretty bad. Soulsborne games were always great at making each area feel unique with its own set of unique enemies, and almost none of that is here. A lot of areas feel roughly the same. \\n\\nWhat's probably worst of all is that despite this being a 6th or 7th title (depending on whether you include Sekiro or not) in the semi-unofficial Soulsborne series, lots of series problems big and small remain unaddressed even in this title. \\nThe camera and lock on system are still bad, and become a huge problem in cramped areas or when fighting giant enemies (and there's a lot of giant enemies here).\\nEnemies can still hit you through walls, even though your own attacks bounce off them, which is super unfair.\\nCritical hits and backstabs are still incredibly finicky to do, meaning you just fail to do them and just perform a regular attack when you stand in a slightly wrong way. Extra bad, when you consider the issue was already solved in Bloodborne. \\n\\nThere's many more, but you get the point. It's really strange to see a developer make the same type of game for over a decade now and still not able to fix these issues (or fixing them in some games only to unfix them in the next title).\\n\\nNow, is the game bad? No. It has plenty of good in it. It looks gorgeous, the art direction and atmosphere are amazing. The build variety for the player is huge, with ability to customize the experience in many ways. The key levels, the ones that clearly had the most time and effort put into them, are almost all amazing to explore, and you can legitimately get lost in these levels with how big they are. The characters are interesting, and the story can be quite intriguing at times. And combat is pretty fun, if still pretty simplistic compared to games in similar genre.\\n\\nBut I don't know why you'd want to play this over any Dark Souls titles. They have all of the things above, but they also are much tighter and polished experiences with variety that is not present in Elden Ring. Those games have so many unique, interesting ideas, whereas Elden Ring feels like a much more toned-down, less unique sort of game made for broad appeal. It's lacking a lot of the soul, pardon the pun. And despite being made for a wider market, I can't say it brings the fixes and the polish that a mass product like this requires. It's a Souls game with a lot of the \"good\" cut out, but also with almost none of the \"bad\" fixed. So I'd only recommend it to someone who's just sick of replaying the previous titles and wants more of the same from the original developers. \\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

The open world makes this game take 10x longer than it should. Dark souls didn't need an open world or crafting mechanics. Game is poorly balanced and copy pastes every minor boss 5 times each in random locations with little reward to pad out the otherwise empty open world.   \n",

The only thing worth of interest are the linear traditional levels, but the crappy generic open world is almost completely worthless, and that's where you will spend most of the time.\\n\\nEven if EVERY From Software game is HIGHLY flawed, Dark Souls 2, 3 or Sekiro are infinitely better games. All From Software games share a considerable amount of serious issues among all of them that FS has never been competent enough to fix (camera issues, terrible netcode, lots of glitches, etc). They also have serious issues specific to each game, like for example DS3's horrible Coal items distribution, or its absolutely retarded \"highest weapon ever upgraded\" online matchmaking system. But the thing is, DS2, DS3 or Sekiro actually AREN'T a borefest like this one.\\n\\nIn those games you don't have to deal with a horrible boring open world that's probably partially procedurally generated, and you're always exploring hand-made linear maps, that most of the time are well done. On this one however, exploring linear maps is a sporadic situation, not the general rule, and the rest of the game is boring to death.\\n\\nAnd of course Sekiro won't ever get an expansion and this one will probably get a ton of them.   \n",

play this RPG game. Because it just decides to turn your build off with its trash boss design when you spend 100+ hours on it.\\nI feel sorry for the time I spent since I had like 5 bosses to end it. But instead, I get one hit death because the boss is only beatable when you roll around it in your trousers. Can't believe we get this garbage after so many of the same games.   \n",

have no idea what they are getting into such as myself. For Skyrim fans this is very enjoyable due to it being in the same franchise and having a lot of the same mechanics.   \n",

                                 Plain and simple. This is a very hard game. You will die, die, and die forever more. If you're looking for a fun game, this is definitely not it. There's no in-game guides, very faint story, nothing great to collect or explore the world for. Almost every enemy you meet is a mini-boss. I've played over 10 hours and have hardly progressed in the game. I don't like games where you're stuck and not moving forward. Maybe I'll give this game another shot, and change this review, but I'm tired of wasting hours and repeating the same defeats.   \n",

                                           I finished the game. I did all the optional hard bosses like Dragonlord Placidusax, Melina, ect., I'm sorry to give it a thumbs down but for me after all was said and done I wouldn't have regretted not playing the game at all, I won't play any potential DLC, and I deleted it from my SSD within 5 minutes of finishing it; in other words I was glad to get it over with. The main reason for the negativity was game immersion, which was always short lived when I was playing, I felt I constantly needed to go on the internet to find something, figure how to do something, figure a quest out and so on, it was a royal and constant pain in the but. The devs put so much into creating a huge and content filled world but left too many things to \"figure out\" on your own with little to no hints as to what to do. On top of that they had some truly annoying AI coding that allowed mobs to hit you with melee attacks through walls, keep targeting you and hit you with spells through walls with no line of site. It was a complete annoyance, meanwhile your avatar's melee weapon bounced off walls as it should, and you lost lock on when you lost line of site. While I've played all the Dark Souls games and Sekiro I'll check the reviews and game play carefully before I consider buying a sequel to Elden Ring. Some may wonder why I bothered to finish it and I would say it was a combination of being a little obsessive and not wanting to let myself back down from the challenge because it was difficult like Dark Souls games and I had more than my fair share of deaths that made me determined to get back up and kill that dam boss or mini boss. Ultimately I was sorry I started it, and couldn't wait to get to over with, hence the negative review.   \n",

                         It's like if Tommy Wiseau was co-producer of Lord of the Rings.  \\n\\nWhat I mean by that, is there is a lot of awesome stuff in this game, but it is interwoven with sloppy garbage.  I could make a list of a 100 things that don't actually deliver that would have been easy to fix.  \\n\\nThere are almost no sections of the game that are purely good or purely bad.  The bad and good aspects are so thoroughly mixed that no part of the game is particularly satisfying.  Overall a big, epic, sloppy, surprisingly unpolished, and lackluster experience.  \\n\\nIf you've got a lot of time on your hands (if you want to get close to 100%-ing the game you're talking around 100 hours) then possibly a worthy buy on discount but other than that avoid this game.   \n",
